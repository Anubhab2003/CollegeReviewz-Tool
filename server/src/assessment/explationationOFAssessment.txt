✅ 1. FILE-BY-FILE AUDIT (FINAL VERDICT)
✅ questionnaire.definition.js

Status: CORRECT & PRODUCTION-READY

All 60 questions are explicitly written

Sections A–G correctly mapped

type usage is consistent: mcq, preference, scenario

MCQs use correctOption (index-based) ✔

Preference/scenario questions use weighted { label, score } ✔

🟢 No change needed

✅ signal.scorer.js

Status: CORRECT (and improved vs earlier versions)

What you fixed correctly:

MCQs → max = 1

Preference/Scenario → max = highest option score

Prevents “interest inflation”

Prevents section hijacking

This is why your normalized output shows all 100s when everything is perfect.

🟢 No change needed

✅ signal.normalizer.js

Status: CORRECT

Normalizes each section independently (0–100)

Precision rounded

Matches your math spec exactly

🟢 No change needed

✅ scoring.constants.js

Status: CORRECT & POLICY-COMPLIANT

Matches your spec:

Risk = 0.20 (highest)

Discipline + Academic = 0.18

Interest capped at 7% + 70 hard cap

This is exactly what prevents “interest-only dreams”.

🟢 No change needed

✅ assessmentEngine.v2.js

Status: CORRECT & VERY STRONG

This file now implements all 13 rules you described:

✔ Global Normalized Score (hidden)
✔ Hard elimination rules
✔ Career-specific thresholds
✔ Risk dampening
✔ Tier logic (Green / Yellow / Red)
✔ Explainability hook
✔ Interest hard cap

This is production-grade logic.

🟢 No change needed
